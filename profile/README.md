# Welcome to the Salt Extensions Community!

This is the official home for community-maintained extensions for the [Salt Project](https://saltproject.io/). Here, we
foster an ecosystem of contributions that extend the capabilities of Salt, a powerful automation and configuration
management tool.

## What Are Salt Extensions?

Salt Extensions, or simply "extensions," are modules, states, grains, returners, and other plugins that enhance the
functionality of Salt. They are created and maintained by the vibrant and innovative Salt community.

## Our Repositories

We host a variety of extensions here, each tailored to different needs and technologies. Some popular extensions
include:

- [saltext-kubernetes](https://github.com/salt-extensions/saltext-kubernetes): Interact with Kubernetes clusters.
- [saltext-vault](https://github.com/salt-extensions/saltext-vault): Manage secrets with HashiCorp's Vault.
- [saltext-prometheus](https://github.com/salt-extensions/saltext-prometheus): Monitor systems with Prometheus.

... and many more!

Explore our [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/salt-extensions/repositories) to find an extension that suits your
needs or to get inspiration for your next contribution.
